- edge betweenness
- node betweenness

- clustering coefficient to identify good clusters
- community analysis
- path length to plant or generator to see WEAK nodes

- robustness analysis

- most damage with 
	- n=1
	- n=2
- remove the least edges to isolate the largest community

- node2vec analysis of sussy nodes

- extend network to optimally improve aforementioned metrics

# Types of Node Classes

1. **Substations**
Think of substations as the traffic controllers of the power grid. Their main purpose is to transform voltage levels - either stepping voltage up for long-distance transmission or stepping it down for local distribution. When power leaves a generating station, it's stepped up to very high voltages (often 400kV or 220kV in Germany) to minimize losses during transmission. As this power gets closer to end users, substations step the voltage down in stages until it reaches levels suitable for homes and businesses (typically 230V in Germany). Substations also house important protective equipment and switching gear that helps control power flow and protect the grid from faults.
